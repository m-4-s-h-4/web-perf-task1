- Vite added
- Used CDN
- Added `brotliCompress`
- Images are optimized using `vite-plugin-imagemin`, reducing file sizes for faster loading.
- JavaScript files are minified using `rollup-plugin-terser`, decreasing load times by removing unnecessary characters and variables.
- For HTML files minification with `vite-plugin-html`, reducing file size by eliminating whitespace and comments.
- Asset bundling and code splitting in Vite improve initial loading times by breaking code into smaller, load-on-demand chunks
- For css `cssnano`
- Minification typically removes `console.log` and `debugger`
- Lazy loading is implemented in HTML for all images.
- The `defer` attribute is used for scripts that don't need to execute immediately after being fetched, reducing render-blocking behavior.
